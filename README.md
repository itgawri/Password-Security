# Password-Security
The "Password Security Management" project focuses on analyzing, assessing, and understanding how long and how many hacking attempts are required to crack a password of a specified length. Below, we present the project's code and its description.

In the project, we calculate the possible number of combinations for a password of a given length (variable "password_length"). To do this, we use a while loop where we multiply the value of the "permutations" variable by numbers from 1 to "password_length." This allows us to determine all potential combinations for a password of the specified length.

Next, we calculate the maximum number of attempts that can be made before the account is locked. We assume a specific number of attempts (variable "attempts") and calculate the maximum number of locks (variable "max_lock") as the quotient of all possible combinations (variable "permutations") divided by the number of attempts.

In the following step, we simulate how many times the account can be locked. In a for loop, we iterate from zero to "max_lock," incrementing the number of locks (variable "locks") with each iteration and calculating the total lock time (variable "total_lock_time") as the product of the number of locks and the lock time multiplier (variable "lock_time_multiplier"). We also display messages informing about the lock time at each iteration.

Finally, in the project, we present the total lock time, assuming that the hacker was only able to guess the password with the last possible combination.

This project allows for the assessment and understanding of how long and how many attempts are needed to crack a password of a given length, which is crucial for the security of user accounts and data.
